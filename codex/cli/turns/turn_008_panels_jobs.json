Extreme close-up comic panel of Rask the Basalt Bull’s OTHER eye being struck by a hyper-concentrated ki needle-ray (no gore): the ray is a thin bright line with a pale vapor-smoke sheath (ki being leeched by the arena lattice), tiny grit-spark bloom at contact, eyelid pinched shut from pain. Dust motes and ozone haze in spotlight. Readable impact lines, intense expression.",

One gloved hand clicks a small remote; the remote shows a tiny indicator glow. Foreground partial: a Saiyan captive’s shock collar at throat with arcs of white-blue static (non-gory), jaw clenched. Background: gate light bleeding white heat, blurred crowd halo.",

Wide shot: Rask the Basalt Bull blinded, head thrown back, both eyes squeezed shut; he thrashes in a widening circle, horns scything air and kicking up sand. A collared Saiyan captive (muscular, scarred, ragged pit wraps) is low and close, mid-dodge. Show the lattice’s influence subtly as faint vapor-smoke wisps lingering where ki was used. No gore; emphasize danger and motion clarity.",
