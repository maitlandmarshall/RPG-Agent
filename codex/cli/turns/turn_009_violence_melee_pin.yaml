  **Hard frame:** Your muscles are still stuttering from the collar bite when you suck in sand-hot air and force your lungs to work anyway.

  You throw your head up and give the arena what it paid for.

  ![VIOLENCE shout, collar arcing](../assets/009_violence_shout_collar_closeup.png)

  “VIOLENCE!”

  The sound hits the bowl and comes back as a wave. The crowd’s roar *locks* onto you like a spotlight.

  [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/items/K-Chain_Shock_Collar.md|The collar]] answers with another lash of white-blue static—warning you off finishing blows, warning you off precision, warning you off being *real*.

  You push through it anyway.

  [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/characters/Rask_the_Basalt_Bull.md|Rask]] is blind and thrashing—horns hunting air by sound and pressure—but he’s still a mountain. You crash into him in the half-beat between swings, get both forearms under his jawline and horn base, and **drive**.

  Fist. Elbow. Forearm. Sand in your mouth. Basalt in your knuckles.

  You keep hitting until the rhythm changes—until his weight stops being *a charge* and becomes *a collapse*.

  ![Drive Rask down](../assets/009_melee_drive_rask_down_action.png)

  Rask goes to one knee, then both, then the sand takes his face with a dull, heavy *thunk*. His horns carve twin trenches as you force him down and keep him there, chest on his back, breath sawing.

  The arena doesn’t like this kind of control.

  Gate-side, machinery wakes up with a rising siren tone. Red warning light spills across the basalt ribs. On the platform, [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/characters/Pitmaster_Veyl.md|Veyl]] lifts the remote like a verdict.

  ![Intervention warning begins](../assets/009_intervention_warning_wide.png)

options:
  - "Finish fast: keep pounding—break the fight before the intervention fully lands (d20 + Strength + Brawling)."
  - "Use him as cover: haul Rask’s bulk between you and the prods, forcing guards to hesitate while you reposition (d20 + Strength + Athletics)."
  - "Information play: look up at Veyl and read the pattern—what exactly triggers the spikes, and what’s the next protocol? (d20 + Intellect + Perception)."
  - "Bargain with the bowl: shout terms to the crowd—‘no prods, no collars’—and try to turn their frenzy into leverage against Veyl (d20 + Strength + Intimidation)."
  - "Disengage clean: release, step back with hands open, and perform compliance to bait a micro-loosening (d20 + Intellect + Intimidation)."
what_changed:
  - "HP -1 (pushing through a fresh collar lash)."
  - "Fatigue +1 (sustained melee drive under shock)."
  - "Position: Rask is driven to the sand and pinned for the moment."
  - "Clock: intervention_protocol starts 0/6 → 1/6 (arena correction spins up)."

  **Core roll**: `d20 + stat + skill` vs DC.

  **Resolved action (your declaration): shout “VIOLENCE” and melee-drive Rask into the sand**
  - **Check**: `d20 + Strength (6) + Brawling (3)` vs **DC 16**
  - **Roll**: `d20=12` + 6 + 3 = **21** → **Success**
  - **Effect**: you beat his blind thrash timing and **drive him down**, buying a brief control window.
  - **Cost**: the collar lashes again when you commit (**HP -1**, **fatigue +1**) and the arena begins intervention sequencing.

  **Audit**
