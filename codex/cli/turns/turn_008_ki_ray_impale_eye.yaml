  **Hard frame:** You’re chest-close—so close you can smell hot stone on [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/characters/Rask_the_Basalt_Bull.md|Rask]]’s breath and feel the grit grind between your teeth.

  His shoulder impact still rings through your ribs.

  You don’t back off.

  You *channel*—a second burn of ki, but this time not a pellet. A **needle-ray**: tight, straight, shaped to *impale*.

  The [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/techniques/Ki-sink_Lattice.md|Ki-sink Lattice]] answers instantly. The beam doesn’t just shine—it **smokes**, a pale vapor sheath peeling off it as the arena tries to drink it mid-flight.

  ![Ki ray to the eye](../assets/008_ki_ray_eye_impale_closeup.png)

  The ray lances into his **other** eye.

  Rask’s head snaps back. For half a heartbeat you see nothing behind his horns but reflex and pain—then his whole body goes rigid, like a bell struck wrong.

  Above the gate platform, [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/characters/Pitmaster_Veyl.md|Veyl]]’s remote hand **clicks**.

  The [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/items/K-Chain_Shock_Collar.md|K-Chain Shock Collar]] doesn’t warn this time.

  It *bites*.

  ![Collar spike and Veyl remote](../assets/008_veyl_remote_collar_spike.png)

  White static floods your throat and jaw, turning muscle into a stutter. Your vision fractures at the edges. The beam wobbles—still in his eye—still smoking—then gutters out as your body betrays you.

  Rask is blind now, but blind doesn’t mean safe. He swings by sound and pressure, sand exploding under his feet as he thrashes in a widening circle—horns scything air where your head *was* a second ago.

options:
  - "Ride the shock and finish the beat: step into his blind arc and smash the liver/ribs while he’s off-balance (d20 + Strength + Brawling)."
  - "Survive first: drop and roll out of horn range, reset distance while your muscles stop stuttering (d20 + Agility + Athletics)."
  - "Control the monster: clamp a horn base/neck and try to steer him into the ring-edge basalt ribs before he finds you (d20 + Strength + Athletics)."
  - "Information play: read Veyl’s cadence—how often can they spike the collar, and what triggers it? (d20 + Intellect + Perception)."
  - "Play to the box: shout ‘VIOLENCE!’ and bait the crowd into forcing Veyl’s hand (d20 + Strength + Intimidation)."
what_changed:
  - "HP -2 (collar spike backlash)."
  - "Fatigue +2 (precision beam + shock recovery)."
  - "Clock: guard_alertness advances 5/6 → 6/6 (collar escalation authorized)."
  - "Clock: crowd_frenzy advances 5/6 → 6/6 (they witness a blinding strike)."
  - "Clock: arena_timer advances 5/6 → 6/6 (official intervention threshold reached)."
  - "Rask: blinded in both eyes; thrashing by sound/pressure at close range."

  **Core roll**: `d20 + stat + skill` vs DC.

  **Resolved action (your declaration): concentrated impaling ki ray into the other eye**
  - **Check**: `d20 + Ki Control (4) + Ki Blast (1)` vs **DC 16**
  - **Roll**: 13 → **18 (Success)**
  - **Effect**: Rask is **blinded** (both eyes compromised) for the immediate exchange; his attacks become wider and less precise, but more dangerous if they connect.
  - **Cost (telegraphed consequences land)**: lethal intent triggers an immediate collar spike (**HP -2**, **fatigue +2**) and pushes attention to a breaking point (**guard_alertness 6/6**, **arena_timer 6/6**, **crowd_frenzy 6/6**).

  **Fictional positioning**
  - The lattice leeched the beam (visible vapor sheath), but at point-blank range the strike still landed.
  - With `arena_timer` at 6/6, the arena’s controllers are about to “correct” the scene next beat (hazard, handlers, or collar rules change).
