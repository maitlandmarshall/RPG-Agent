Close-up comic panel of Rask the Basalt Bull’s face: basalt-textured brow, heavy horn base in frame, one eye squinting shut as a tiny ki pellet splats against the wet eye/cheek with a gritty spark-bloom. The ki pellet leaves a thin vapor-smoke trail (ki being leeched) despite the dry air; dust motes and ozone haze catch the spotlight. Dynamic impact lines, no gore.",

Action panel, low angle: a collared Saiyan captive (muscular, scarred, ragged pit wraps, shock collar) staying low and dashing forward through a plume of pale vapor-smoke; sand sprays from their feet. Rask the Basalt Bull recoils, one eye stung shut, horns and massive shoulder turning as the Saiyan slips inside the horn line. Clear readable motion, comic panel framing.",

Close-up panel on Pitmaster Veyl on the gate platform: lacquer-black coat stitched in sickly gold, mirrored respirator reflecting spotlights, clean gloves.
