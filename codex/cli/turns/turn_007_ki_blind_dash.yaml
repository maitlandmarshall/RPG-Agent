  **Hard frame:** The sand is hotter than it looks. It bites your ankles and clings to sweat that hasn’t had time to dry. The spotlights pin you in a white circle while the crowd blurs into a single hungry sound.

  ![Rask on the sand](../assets/005_rask_on_sand_wide.png)

  Across from you, [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/characters/Rask_the_Basalt_Bull.md|Rask]] stands like a moving cliff—too still, too grounded, saving his burst.

  You drop low.

  You let your sealed ki crack open just enough to slip a *small* pellet through the collar’s attention—tight, quiet, precise—then you flick it toward his eyes.

  The [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/techniques/Ki-sink_Lattice.md|Ki-sink Lattice]] under the sand *tugs* at the shot mid-flight. The pellet thins, hissing, shedding a wake of pale vapor like a comet tail that shouldn’t exist in dry air.

  ![Ki-sink lattice under sand](../assets/006_lattice_under_sand_macro.png)

  It still lands—*spat*—against basalt brow and wet eye, bursting into a grit-spark bloom. Rask jerks his head, one eye sealing shut as he shakes, snorting sand and smoke.

  The [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/items/K-Chain_Shock_Collar.md|K-Chain Shock Collar]] warms at your throat—warning-hot, a thin static itch that says: *we felt that.*

  You don’t wait for the bite.

  In the recoil and plume, you sprint—low as a thrown knife—sand spraying behind you. The world narrows to the angle under his horns, the timing between his breath and your footfall.

  You slip inside the line of his first swing… and his mass still clips you—basalt shoulder grazing ribs with a dead, heavy impact that knocks air out of you.

  Above the gate platform, you catch a lacquer-black glint: [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/characters/Pitmaster_Veyl.md|Pitmaster Veyl]]’s remote hand doesn’t move, but you *feel* their attention tighten.

options:
  - "Stay glued to him: chain short, hands up—hammer ribs and kidneys before his vision clears (d20 + Strength + Brawling)."
  - "Control the horns: hook an arm under the base and turn his head, trying to steer his charge into the ring-edge basalt ribs (d20 + Strength + Athletics)."
  - "Information play: disengage one step and read his eye/footwork—how blind is he, and what’s his burst trigger? (d20 + Intellect + Perception)."
  - "Talk through the roar: snap a pact offer—‘We both live if we stall’—and see if he hesitates for a beat (d20 + Intellect + Intimidation)."
  - "Risk the collar: fire a second micro-blast into the sand to kick up a blinding sheet and reposition behind him (d20 + Ki Control + Ki Blast)."
what_changed:
  - "HP -3 (basalt-shoulder clip as you close)."
  - "Fatigue +1 (ki flick + sprint under pressure)."
  - "Clock: arena_timer advances 4/6 → 5/6."
  - "Clock: crowd_frenzy advances 4/6 → 5/6."
  - "Clock: guard_alertness advances 4/6 → 5/6 (visible ki use on sand)."
  - "Position: you’re inside Rask’s horn line at close range; his right eye is stung/obscured for a beat."

  **Core roll**: `d20 + stat + skill` vs DC.

  **Resolved action (your declaration): micro ki-blind + low dash into melee**
  - **Check**: `d20 + Agility (5) + Ki Blast (1)` vs **DC 15**
  - **Roll**: 12 → **18 (Success)**
  - **Effect**: Rask flinches and loses clean sight for **1 beat**, letting you get inside his first clean swing.
  - **Cost (fail-forward pressure anyway)**: you still eat the edge of his mass on entry (**HP -3**) and the collar registers the flare (**fatigue +1**, **guard_alertness +1**).

  **Fictional positioning**
  - The lattice drains big surges fast; small, tight shots can still land but they “smoke” as they’re leeched.
  - Close range vs Rask is dangerous: his weight turns glancing contact into injury.

  **Panel note**
  - Reused existing arena panels this turn; new panel generation is blocked until `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set (for `.codex/skills/openai-image-gen`).
