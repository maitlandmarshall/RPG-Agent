# Visual Style — Planet Vegeta (Age 736)

Use these keywords in every image prompt.

## Baseline Look
- retro shōnen anime look; 1980s–90s cel shading
- clean, bold ink outlines; simple shadow shapes; minimal gradient use
- dramatic rim light; hard-edged highlights on armor and hair
- materials: matte white battle armor, worn leather straps, scuffed metal, dusty stone
- atmosphere: red-brown sky haze, windblown grit, distant engine smoke, heat shimmer
- palette: warm earth reds and oranges, pale armor whites, deep blue-black hair, occasional scouter green glow

## Composition Notes
- treat each image like a comic panel: clear focal point, readable silhouettes
- wide establishing shots for city/landscape scale; tight close-ups for emotion and tells
- motion is readable: clean speed-lines implied by pose, not literal drawn text

## Character Visual Canon (Low-Class Saiyan)
- compact athletic build; battle-worn low-class armor; scratches and repairs visible
- hair: gravity-defying silhouette (player will define the exact shape)
- tail: present by default unless the player chooses otherwise (often wrapped or belted)
