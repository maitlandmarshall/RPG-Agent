# Unnamed Saiyan

![Unnamed Saiyan](Unnamed_Saiyan_portrait.png)

Low-class Saiyan on Planet Vegeta, living through the year before everything changes.

**Tags**: #character #saiyan #low_class

## Snapshot
- **Goal**: Stay fed, stay sharp, stay free of attention—until you can’t.
- **Leverage**: Saiyan instincts; street-practical ki; endurance.
- **Fear/Desire**: Fear of becoming expendable; desire to matter on your own terms.
- **Current Status**: Stationed in Vegeta City’s low-class barracks; muster tempo increasing.

## Sensory Notes
Armor that never quite dries; dust that tastes like metal; the constant background whine of engines and scouters.
