# Low-Class Barracks (Vegeta City)

![Low-Class Barracks](Low_Class_Barracks_establishing.png)

A concrete-and-metal hive for the low-class: bunks stacked tight, armor hung like shedding skin, the air always tasting of sweat and dust.

## Sensory Notes
Cold metal under your shoulder blades. Scouter chirps bouncing off bare walls. The sour edge of recycled air fighting the smell of bodies and oil.
