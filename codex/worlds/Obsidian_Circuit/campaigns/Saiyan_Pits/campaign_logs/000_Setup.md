# 000 — Setup

You are a Saiyan captive in the Obsidian Circuit: an interstellar gladiatorial economy that sells pain as entertainment.

You’ve survived one year in the pits—long enough to learn the rules that aren’t written down: the collars bite, the odds lie, and mercy is a currency you rarely get to spend.

**Now Playing**
- **Location**: Obsidian Pits — Holding Cells (Under-Arena)
- **HP**: 32
- **Fatigue**: 5
- **Hunger**: 3
- **XP**: 12

## Canon Questions (Answer In-Character Or OOC)
- Do you still have your tail? (bound/clamped vs removed)
- What’s your name (or what do they call you in the pits)?
- What’s your signature “tell” when you’re about to explode into action?

### Scene
**Hard frame:** You’re in the [[../../lore/locations/Obsidian_Pits.md|Obsidian Pits]]—under-arena holding cells—where the stone is colder than space and the air tastes like pennies.

![Under-arena holding cells](../assets/001_holding_cells_establishing.png)

The **[[../../lore/items/K-Chain_Shock_Collar.md|K-Chain Shock Collar]]** sits heavy at your throat. It doesn’t just *weigh*—it *listens*. Every time your ki rises on instinct, the collar answers with a thin static itch that crawls under your skin like ants.

Tonight, the corridor is louder than usual. Boots on catwalk grates. A muffled roar above, like a storm trapped in a dome.

Then the bell hits.

![The bell travels through the chain](../assets/001_bell_chain_closeup.png)

Not a chime—an impact. The sound rolls through the walls and into your teeth. Across the cells, prisoners go still the way prey goes still: hoping movement won’t make them the choice.

A line of guards in matte helmets stops at your bars. Their prods crackle blue-white, the smell of ozone sharpening the air. Behind them glides [[../../lore/characters/Pitmaster_Veyl.md|Pitmaster Veyl]]—clean gloves, mirrored respirator, that lacquer-black coat stitched in sickly gold.

“Asset,” Veyl says, voice soft enough to make it intimate. “One year. Still breathing. The [[../../lore/factions/Obsidian_Circuit.md|Obsidian Circuit]] loves a stubborn story.”

The collar warms—just a warning pulse—and you understand the message: **tonight isn’t a routine bout.**

Veyl tilts their head as if listening to a distant crowd chant you can’t hear yet. “Before we open the gate,” they add, “I want to know what to call you when you disappoint me.”

The guard nearest you hooks a chain through the bars and gives it a testing tug, like measuring how much of you will follow it.
### Your Options
1. Play it cold and compliant—save your ki for the sand (d20 + Strength + Brawling).
2. Scout: read guards, exits, and Veyl’s tells before you move (d20 + Intellect + Perception).
3. Test the collar: micro-burst ki control to map its threshold without triggering a full shock (d20 + Ki Control + Survival).
4. Talk back—turn the crowd’s hunger into leverage, demand terms or a weapon (d20 + Strength + Intimidation).
5. Go for it: attempt an escape into the catwalk/vent network when the gate cycle starts (d20 + Agility + Athletics).

### What Changed
- Clock: matchmaker_bell advances 4/6 → 5/6.
- Fatigue +1 (forced wake-up and pre-fight handling).
- New pressure: Pitmaster Veyl is personally present.

**Core roll**: `d20 + stat + skill` vs DC.

**Option DCs (baseline)**
- **1 (Compliant / conserve)**: DC 12 (avoid provoking a shock response while staying ready).
- **2 (Scout)**: DC 13 (spot an exit pattern / hidden restraint protocol).
- **3 (Collar threshold test)**: DC 15 (success = learn the “yellow line”; fail = partial shock + alertness tick).
- **4 (Leverage / terms)**: DC 14 (success = small concession; fail = collar warning + guard hostility).
- **5 (Escape attempt)**: DC 17 (success = break contact; fail = immediate stun + lockdown).

**World clocks (current)**
- `matchmaker_bell`: 5/6 (gate call is imminent)
- `guard_alertness`: 2/6
- `hunger`: 3/6
- `rumor_of_vegeta`: 1/6

## Turn — 2025-12-23 23:35
### Scene
You let the silence stretch—long enough for the guards to shift their weight, long enough for the chain to stop pretending it isn’t a leash.

Your mouth curls.

“I am violence.”

The words hit the corridor like a thrown stone. Somewhere down the line, a prisoner exhales like they’ve been holding their breath for hours.

![Veyl amused at the bars](../assets/002_veyl_amused_closeup.png)

[[../../lore/characters/Pitmaster_Veyl.md|Pitmaster Veyl]] doesn’t flinch. Their head tilts a fraction, the mirrored respirator plate catching the fluorescents and throwing your reflection back at you in thin, broken slices.

“Violence,” Veyl repeats, as if tasting a vintage. “A *claim*. Or a *name*.”

The guard at your bars tightens the chain one link.

The collar answers before you do—warming at the seam, a warning that crawls under your skin.

![Collar warning pulse](../assets/002_collar_warning_pulse.png)

Blue static needles your throat. Not the full bite—just the promise of it. Veyl’s gloved thumb rests on the remote like a question mark.

Above, the crowd surges. You feel it through the stone: stamping feet, a chant turning into a single hungry animal.

The bell hits again.

This time, the corridor lights stutter—and the far gate begins to open.

![Gate call lightspill](../assets/002_gate_call_lightspill.png)

A seam of arena-light spills into the under-dark. Hot. Bright. Cruel. The smell changes first: sand, sweat, scorched metal.

Veyl leans closer, voice for you alone. “If you want the Circuit to *say* your name… you earn it. If you want to keep your throat intact… you choose your next breath carefully.”
### Your Options
1. Make it official: demand the announcer calls you **Violence**—and accept whatever “price” Veyl names (d20 + Strength + Intimidation).
2. Play it tactical: give a fake name, keep Violence as your private vow, and watch Veyl’s tells (d20 + Intellect + Perception).
3. Test boundaries: hold eye contact and deliberately raise ki a hair—dare the collar to prove it owns you (d20 + Ki Control + Survival).
4. Switch the angle: bargain for a weapon/gear concession in exchange for a dramatic opening (d20 + Intellect + Intimidation).
5. Save it for the sand: nod, conserve, and focus on reading the gate sequence for an escape window (d20 + Agility + Athletics).

### What Changed
- Clock: matchmaker_bell advances 5/6 → 6/6 (gate cycle begins).
- Clock: guard_alertness advances 2/6 → 3/6 (provoked attention).
- Pressure: collar warning threshold lowered for the next few minutes.

<summary>Mechanics</summary>

**Core roll**: `d20 + stat + skill` vs DC.

**Fictional positioning**
- Your declaration (“I am violence.”) puts you on Veyl’s radar: higher risk, higher leverage.
- Until the gate closes behind you, the collar is “hair-trigger” (failures involving ki/intimidation may add a shock complication).

**Option DCs (baseline)**
- **1 (Demand the name)**: DC 15 (success = crowd-branding; fail = collar punishment / terms worsen).
- **2 (Fake name + read tells)**: DC 13 (success = learn Veyl’s angle; fail = you miss a key tell).
- **3 (Ki dare)**: DC 16 (success = map threshold; fail = partial shock + alertness tick).
- **4 (Gear bargain)**: DC 15 (success = small concession; fail = immediate refusal + collar warning).
- **5 (Conserve + watch gate)**: DC 14 (success = spot a timing gap; fail = you’re chained tighter at rollout).
