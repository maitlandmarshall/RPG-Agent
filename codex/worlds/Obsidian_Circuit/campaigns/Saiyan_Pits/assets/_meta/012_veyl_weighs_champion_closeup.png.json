Expression/body language reads as controlled interest rather than anger. Red warning light glow, crowd blur, guard silhouettes with a shock-net rig in motion. Dust/ozone haze, tight cross-hatching, high-contrast rim light. Constraints: no text, no watermark.\n\nConstraints: no text, no watermark.",
