  "prompt_final": "WORLD STYLE PACK (use consistently): Baseline look: gritty sci\u2011fi gladiator arena; inked line art, tight cross\u2011hatching, crisp silhouettes; high contrast lighting, deep shadows, sharp rim light; materials: basalt, rusted steel, pitted chrome, chain, scarred skin; atmosphere: dust motes, steam vents, ozone haze, harsh fluorescents; palette: muted charcoal/iron with neon accents (cyan, magenta, sickly gold); camera: cinematic framing, wide establishing shots + intense close\u2011ups | Composition: treat each image like a comic panel: clear focal point, readable action; emphasize scale (catwalks above pits, towering gates, crowds as a blur); keep violence visceral but not gratuitous (impact, tension, consequence)\n\nWide corridor shot: a far gate begins to open, a seam of blinding arena light spilling into the under-dark. Dust and sand grit in the beam, silhouettes of guards and bars, heat shimmer and steam vents. Composition emphasizes the light as a wound in darkness.\n\nConstraints: no text, no watermark.",
