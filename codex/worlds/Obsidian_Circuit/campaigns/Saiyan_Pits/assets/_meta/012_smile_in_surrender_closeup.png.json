The K-Chain shock collar glows warning-hot but does not arc. Foreground: sand grit and the tip of a guard's prod crackling, hovering uncertain. Background: basalt ribs and crowd blur, dust motes, ozone haze, crisp silhouettes, high-contrast rim light. Nonsexual, nonromantic. Constraints: no text, no watermark.\n\nConstraints: no text, no watermark.",
