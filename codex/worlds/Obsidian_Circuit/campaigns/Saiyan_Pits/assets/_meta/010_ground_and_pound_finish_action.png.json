Collar arcing intense white-blue static at the throat, sweat and sand on skin, knuckles scraped. Rask\u2019s eyes ruined/blinded but no gore; focus on impact, tension, and leverage. High-contrast comic-panel composition, crisp silhouettes, harsh rim light, dust motes in spotlights.\n\nConstraints: no text, no watermark.",
