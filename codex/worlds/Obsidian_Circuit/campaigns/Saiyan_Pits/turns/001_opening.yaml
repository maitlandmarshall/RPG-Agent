  **Hard frame:** You’re in the [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/locations/Obsidian_Pits.md|Obsidian Pits]]—under-arena holding cells—where the stone is colder than space and the air tastes like pennies.

  The **[[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/items/K-Chain_Shock_Collar.md|K-Chain Shock Collar]]** sits heavy at your throat. It doesn’t just *weigh*—it *listens*. Every time your ki rises on instinct, the collar answers with a thin static itch that crawls under your skin like ants.

  Tonight, the corridor is louder than usual. Boots on catwalk grates. A muffled roar above, like a storm trapped in a dome.

  Then the bell hits.

  ![The bell travels through the chain](../assets/001_bell_chain_closeup.png)

  Not a chime—an impact. The sound rolls through the walls and into your teeth. Across the cells, prisoners go still the way prey goes still: hoping movement won’t make them the choice.

  A line of guards in matte helmets stops at your bars. Their prods crackle blue-white, the smell of ozone sharpening the air. Behind them glides [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/characters/Pitmaster_Veyl.md|Pitmaster Veyl]]—clean gloves, mirrored respirator, that lacquer-black coat stitched in sickly gold.

  “Asset,” Veyl says, voice soft enough to make it intimate. “One year. Still breathing. The [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/factions/Obsidian_Circuit.md|Obsidian Circuit]] loves a stubborn story.”

  The collar warms—just a warning pulse—and you understand the message: **tonight isn’t a routine bout.**

  Veyl tilts their head as if listening to a distant crowd chant you can’t hear yet. “Before we open the gate,” they add, “I want to know what to call you when you disappoint me.”

  The guard nearest you hooks a chain through the bars and gives it a testing tug, like measuring how much of you will follow it.

options:
  - "Play it cold and compliant—save your ki for the sand (d20 + Strength + Brawling)."
  - "Scout: read guards, exits, and Veyl’s tells before you move (d20 + Intellect + Perception)."
  - "Test the collar: micro-burst ki control to map its threshold without triggering a full shock (d20 + Ki Control + Survival)."
  - "Talk back—turn the crowd’s hunger into leverage, demand terms or a weapon (d20 + Strength + Intimidation)."
  - "Go for it: attempt an escape into the catwalk/vent network when the gate cycle starts (d20 + Agility + Athletics)."

what_changed:
  - "Clock: matchmaker_bell advances 4/6 → 5/6."
  - "Fatigue +1 (forced wake-up and pre-fight handling)."
  - "New pressure: Pitmaster Veyl is personally present."

  **Core roll**: `d20 + stat + skill` vs DC.

  **Option DCs (baseline)**
  - **1 (Compliant / conserve)**: DC 12 (avoid provoking a shock response while staying ready).
  - **2 (Scout)**: DC 13 (spot an exit pattern / hidden restraint protocol).
  - **3 (Collar threshold test)**: DC 15 (success = learn the “yellow line”; fail = partial shock + alertness tick).
  - **4 (Leverage / terms)**: DC 14 (success = small concession; fail = collar warning + guard hostility).
  - **5 (Escape attempt)**: DC 17 (success = break contact; fail = immediate stun + lockdown).

  **World clocks (current)**
  - `matchmaker_bell`: 5/6 (gate call is imminent)
  - `guard_alertness`: 2/6
  - `hunger`: 3/6
  - `rumor_of_vegeta`: 1/6
