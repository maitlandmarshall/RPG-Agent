  The net keeps coming down—slow, inevitable—cables humming as they drink charge.

  You don’t lower your hands.

  You *smile* up at [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/characters/Pitmaster_Veyl.md|Pitmaster Veyl]] like you’ve just been offered dessert instead of a cage.

  ![Smile in surrender](../assets/012_smile_in_surrender_closeup.png)

  “Let me fight the champion.”

  The crowd’s roar shifts—less pure bloodlust, more **anticipation**, like a blade being tested for balance.

  On the rail, Veyl’s mirrored plate catches the arena lights and throws them back at you in broken strips. Their glove rests on the remote—still. Listening.

  ![Veyl weighs it](../assets/012_veyl_weighs_champion_closeup.png)

  A guard takes one involuntary half-step, prod crackling, then freezes again at Veyl’s silence.

options:
  - "Press the advantage: specify terms—no kill‑shock redline, no net, and a clean fight contract—while Veyl is listening (d20 + Intellect + Intimidation)."
  - "Make it a product: offer a controlled show (opening move, signature line) in exchange for the champion booking and a ration/medical credit (d20 + Intellect + Intimidation)."
  - "Information play: ask who the champion is and what they’re known for—then watch Veyl’s micro‑tells (d20 + Intellect + Perception)."
  - "Keep surrender, take the win: let them net you without a struggle while you keep eye contact—bank the promise for later (d20 + Intellect + Survival)."
  - "Exploit the pause: roll under the tightening cables toward the basalt ribs before the net pins your shoulders (d20 + Agility + Athletics)."

what_changed:
  - "You publicly request the champion; Veyl *listens* instead of immediately spiking you."
  - "Fatigue +0.5 (tremor hold, forced posture under a live net)."
  - "Clock: intervention_protocol advances 4/6 → 5/6 (net closing; extraction window narrowing)."
  - "Pressure: the crowd’s hunger shifts from blood to booking—dangerous leverage."

  **Core roll**: `d20 + stat + skill` vs DC.

  **Resolved action (your declaration): maintain surrender, beam at Veyl, and demand the champion bout**
  - **Check**: `d20 + Intellect (3) + Intimidation (2)` vs **DC 16**
  - **Roll**: `d20=12` + 3 + 2 = **17** → **Success**
  - **Effect**: you frame the moment as *entertainment leverage*; Veyl pauses punishment to assess the value of the booking.
  - **Cost (fail‑forward pressure anyway)**: the net still descends and your control window is shrinking (**fatigue +0.5**, **intervention_protocol +1**).

  **Audit**
  - Roll recorded in `campaign_logs/_rolls.ndjson` (nonce `fb3dfb1b89568fd3`).
