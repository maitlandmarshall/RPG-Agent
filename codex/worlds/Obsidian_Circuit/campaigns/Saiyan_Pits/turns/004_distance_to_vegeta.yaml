  The lift platform shudders under your feet as the handlers lock chains into new slots. Metal sings. The arena’s heat licks closer—dry as a furnace—while the crowd’s roar pours down the throat of the tunnel.

  Veyl walks at your shoulder, remote loose in their gloved hand like it weighs nothing.

  You take the gift they offered and spend it.

  “How far is [[../../lore/locations/Planet_Vegeta.md|Planet Vegeta]] from here?”

  For a heartbeat, even the guards hesitate—like you’ve named something sharp in a place built to keep you blunt.

  Veyl raises two fingers. A thin projector in their glove blooms a starfield into the air: cold points, hard lines, and a route drawn in sickly-gold segments that bend around places you’ve never heard named.

  “Far enough that the word ‘home’ becomes fiction,” Veyl says. “Twenty-two relay jumps through Circuit lanes, if you had clearance. Longer if you don’t.”

  Their thumb taps the remote—*click*—and the collar warms just a shade, like punctuation.

  “And if you’re asking because you think distance is mercy,” they add, voice gentle. “It isn’t. Distance is a kind of chain. The Circuit is very good at chains.”

  The lift begins to rise.

  ![Lift rises toward the roar](../assets/004_lift_rising_gate.png)

  White light spills down over you in sheets. Sand-grit rides the air and catches on your teeth. Above, the chant tightens into a single name-shaped hunger—waiting to see if Violence is a story… or a stain.

options:
  - "Call the lie: study the holo-route for tells (missing hops, deliberate misdirection) and pin Veyl to specifics (d20 + Intellect + Perception)."
  - "Turn it into leverage: promise a crowd-pleasing opener in exchange for **one more answer** (coordinates, sector, or relay name) (d20 + Strength + Intimidation)."
  - "Weaponize the moment: shout “Vegeta” loud enough for the handlers to hear—test whether the word spooks the Circuit (d20 + Strength + Intimidation)."
  - "Say nothing, memorize everything: burn the route into your mind for a future escape plan (d20 + Intellect + Survival)."
  - "Focus on the now: brace for the gate and choose the cleanest opening strike the moment the sand hits your feet (d20 + Agility + Athletics)."

what_changed:
  - "Clock: arena_timer advances 1/6 → 2/6 (lift rising; gate imminent)."
  - "Clock: crowd_frenzy advances 1/6 → 2/6 (they feel the moment tighten)."
  - "Clock: rumor_of_vegeta advances 1/6 → 2/6 (the word moves in the dark)."
  - "Pressure: Veyl confirms Circuit relay lanes exist—but only for those with clearance."

  **Core roll**: `d20 + stat + skill` vs DC.

  **Fictional positioning**
  - Your one “free question” is spent; further answers require leverage (theatrics, compliance, or risk).
  - Mentioning Vegeta is socially dangerous: it can draw attention from the wrong listeners.

  **Option DCs (baseline)**
  - **1 (Call the lie / read route)**: DC 14 (success = identify a tell + one true relay name; fail = you misread and lock in bad intel).
  - **2 (Bargain for one more answer)**: DC 15 (success = one additional concrete fact; fail = collar warning + Veyl closes up).
  - **3 (Say “Vegeta” loud)**: DC 15 (success = you learn who reacts and how; fail = guard_alertness tick + rough handling).
  - **4 (Memorize the route)**: DC 13 (success = bank actionable intel; fail = details blur under pressure).
  - **5 (Ready the opening strike)**: DC 14 (success = advantageous first beat; fail = you step onto sand off-balance).
