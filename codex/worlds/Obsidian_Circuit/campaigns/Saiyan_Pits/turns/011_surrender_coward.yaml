  **Hard frame:** The sand is still settling around [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/characters/Rask_the_Basalt_Bull.md|Rask]]’s body when the shock‑net blooms overhead—cables unfurling like a steel spiderweb, prods crackling blue‑white at the edges of your vision.

  You put both hands up. Open palms. No tricks.

  ![Hands up in the sand](../assets/011_surrender_hands_up_closeup.png)

  The [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/items/K-Chain_Shock_Collar.md|K‑Chain Shock Collar]] burns warning‑hot at your throat—redline heat without the full bite. The arena’s **ki‑sink lattice** drinks the aftertaste of your violence, leaving only dust and ozone.

  You stare straight up at [[worlds/Obsidian_Circuit/lore/characters/Pitmaster_Veyl.md|Pitmaster Veyl]]—through the mirrored respirator, through the rail, through the roar—and you give them one clean word anyway:

  “Coward.”

  The crowd surges like a single animal smelling fresh blood and fresh **drama**.

  Veyl’s gloved hand lowers the remote a fraction—not mercy, not fear. **Control**.

  ![Veyl reacts](../assets/011_veyl_reaction_closeup.png)

  A guard’s prod hovers near your ribs, waiting for Veyl’s nod. The net keeps dropping.

options:
  - "Hold surrender and talk: keep your hands open and demand terms (water/medical, collar easing) while Veyl’s attention is on you (d20 + Intellect + Intimidation)."
  - "Information play: ask Veyl what exactly triggers the kill‑shock redline, and watch for the lie (d20 + Intellect + Perception)."
  - "Slip the net: time the cable cinch and roll under it toward the basalt ribs before they pin your shoulders (d20 + Agility + Athletics)."
  - "Make it public: repeat the insult loud enough to carry, trying to force Veyl into a crowd‑safe concession (d20 + Strength + Intimidation)."
  - "Feign the shock: let your body go slack like the collar hit you harder, bait a loosened grip, then slip a wrist (d20 + Intellect + Survival)."
  - "Dirty disarm: let a guard close, then snatch the prod and jam it into the net rig as it settles (d20 + Strength + Brawling)."

what_changed:
  - "You surrender with hands up and still land the insult; Veyl pauses the immediate escalation."
  - "Fatigue +0.5 (tremor‑aftershock, forced stillness under a live net)."
  - "Clock: intervention_protocol advances 3/6 → 4/6 (containment shifts from punishment to extraction)."
  - "Position: shock‑net is descending; guards are within striking distance, waiting on Veyl’s signal."

  **Core roll**: `d20 + stat + skill` vs DC.

  **Resolved action (your declaration): surrender with hands up while needling Veyl (“coward”)**
  - **Check**: `d20 + Intellect (3) + Intimidation (2)` vs **DC 15**
  - **Roll**: `d20=15` + 3 + 2 = **20** → **Success**
  - **Effect**: you keep control of your body language under redline pressure and force Veyl to *acknowledge* you instead of simply spiking you on instinct.
  - **Cost (fail‑forward pressure anyway)**: you’re still getting taken—net and hands—just with the prods held back for the moment (**fatigue +0.5**, **intervention_protocol +1**).
