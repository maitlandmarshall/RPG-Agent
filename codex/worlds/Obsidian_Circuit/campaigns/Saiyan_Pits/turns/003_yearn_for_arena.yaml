  **Hard frame:** The gate seam is open now—just a blade of arena-light cutting the under-dark. It turns dust into glitter and makes every chain-link look like a tooth.

  You hold [[../../lore/characters/Pitmaster_Veyl.md|Pitmaster Veyl]]’s reflection in their respirator and don’t blink.

  “I am Violence,” you say again—slower this time, like you’re carving it into stone. “This pit has taken all else.”

  You lean into the collar’s weight, let it feel your pulse.

  “When is my next fight?” Your voice comes out dry. “I yearn for the arena.”

  ![Veyl hears your hunger](../assets/003_veyl_hears_hunger_closeup.png)

  Veyl’s head tilts, a precise angle—curiosity dressed up as control. Their gloved thumb taps the remote once, not to shock you, but to remind you it *can*.

  “A schedule,” Veyl murmurs. “You still believe in *time*.”

  They gesture with two fingers. The guards move as one: the chain goes taut, your shoulders yank forward, and the collar warms—yellow-line hot—until you taste copper.

  “Your next fight is not a date,” Veyl says as they walk beside you. “It’s a door.”

  The bell hits again overhead—closer now, louder—followed by the crowd’s roar rolling down the tunnel like a pressure wave.

  “And it’s opening.”

  ![Rollout tunnel wide](../assets/003_rollout_tunnel_wide.png)

  The corridor bends. Heat pours in from ahead, washing over your skin in dry waves. The air changes—sand, sweat, scorched metal—so thick you can almost chew it.

  Ahead: a grated ramp, a lift platform, a slit of blinding white. A handler’s voice barks numbers you don’t recognize. Chains clatter into new hooks.

  Veyl keeps pace, close enough that you catch the faint, antiseptic bite of their gloves. “You get one question before the sand,” they add, soft as a gift. “Choose it well.”

  ![Arena light on sand](../assets/003_arena_light_on_sand.png)

  Beyond the threshold you glimpse it: a bowl of black stone and screaming light, the arena floor like a pale wound under spotlamps. Somewhere out there, something heavy lands once—*thump*—and the crowd answers with hunger.

options:
  - "Spend your one question on **the opponent**: force Veyl to name what’s waiting on the sand (d20 + Intellect + Perception)."
  - "Spend it on **the rules**: demand the win condition, ring hazards, and whether weapons are allowed (d20 + Intellect + Intimidation)."
  - "Spend it on **a concession**: trade theatrics—\"Violence\" shouted loud—for a small gear edge (wraps, gloves, or a blunt weapon) (d20 + Strength + Intimidation)."
  - "Say nothing—watch Veyl instead: read the remote hand, guard spacing, and the ramp cadence for an escape seam (d20 + Intellect + Perception)."
  - "Make the tunnel your first arena: attempt to break the chain in the rollout crush and start a disruption before the gate (d20 + Strength + Athletics)."

what_changed:
  - "Location: Obsidian Pits — Holding Cells → Gate Tunnel (rollout)."
  - "Clock: matchmaker_bell resets 6/6 → 0/6 (cycle spent; rollout underway)."
  - "Clock: arena_timer starts 0/6 → 1/6 (you’re seconds from the sand)."
  - "Clock: crowd_frenzy starts 0/6 → 1/6 (they smell blood on the air)."
  - "Fatigue +0.5 (handled, chained, marched)."
  - "New pressure: Veyl grants exactly one question before the gate."

  **Core roll**: `d20 + stat + skill` vs DC.

  **Fictional positioning**
  - In the rollout tunnel, guards have leverage: chain + prods + collar. Loud defiance risks a collar spike.
  - Veyl’s “one question” is real leverage: a clean success can reshape the fight before it starts (information, rule clarity, or a small concession).

  **Option DCs (baseline)**
  - **1 (Ask the opponent)**: DC 13 (success = name + one useful detail; fail = evasive answer / misdirection).
  - **2 (Ask the rules)**: DC 14 (success = clear win condition + hazard warning; fail = partial/loaded answer).
  - **3 (Concession for theatrics)**: DC 15 (success = small gear edge; fail = collar warning + guard roughness).
  - **4 (Read Veyl + cadence)**: DC 14 (success = spot a timing seam; fail = you miss the shift and get pinned).
  - **5 (Break chain/disrupt)**: DC 17 (success = brief chaos + escape opening; fail = immediate stun + guard_alertness tick).
