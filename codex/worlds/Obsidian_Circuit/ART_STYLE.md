# Visual Style — Obsidian Circuit

Use these keywords in every image prompt.

## Baseline Look
- gritty sci‑fi gladiator arena
- inked line art, tight cross‑hatching, crisp silhouettes
- high contrast lighting, deep shadows, sharp rim light
- materials: basalt, rusted steel, pitted chrome, chain, scarred skin
- atmosphere: dust motes, steam vents, ozone haze, harsh fluorescents
- palette: muted charcoal/iron with neon accents (cyan, magenta, sickly gold)
- camera: cinematic framing, wide establishing shots + intense close‑ups

## Composition Notes
- treat each image like a comic panel: clear focal point, readable action
- emphasize scale (catwalks above pits, towering gates, crowds as a blur)
- keep violence visceral but not gratuitous (impact, tension, consequence)

## Character Visual Canon (Saiyan Captive)
- muscular, compact power; battle scars; worn wraps; collar/chain hardware
- hair: thick, gravity‑defying silhouette (unique shape per player choice later)
- tail: if present, usually bound/clamped (confirm with player)
