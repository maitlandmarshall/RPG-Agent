# Obsidian Pits

![Obsidian Pits](Obsidian_Pits_establishing.png)

## Summary
The under-arena holding labyrinth: basalt corridors, iron cages, and a constant haze of ozone from collars and stun prods.

## Sensory Description
Cold stone sweats in sheets; metal tastes like old blood. Every sound carries—chain rattle, distant crowd roar, the bell’s hollow thump traveling through your teeth.
