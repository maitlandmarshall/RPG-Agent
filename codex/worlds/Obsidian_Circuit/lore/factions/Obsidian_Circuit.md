# Obsidian Circuit

![Obsidian Circuit](Obsidian_Circuit_sigil.png)

## Summary
An intergalactic gladiatorial civilization that profits from captured fighters, engineered rivalries, and broadcast carnage.

## Goal
Convert violence into stable revenue: keep fights dramatic, outcomes controllable, and assets replaceable.

## Leverage
- Shock collars, ration control, match-fixing contracts
- Crowd influence (chants become policy)
- Debt: buy freedom, then owe the Circuit forever

## Fear / Desire
- **Fear**: a unified revolt across the pits
- **Desire**: a “legend” champion they can brand and sell

## Current Status
The Circuit’s season is peaking; matchmakers are escalating stakes and tightening collars.
