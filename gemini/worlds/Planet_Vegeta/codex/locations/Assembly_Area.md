# Sector 4 Assembly Area

The staging ground where slaves are marshaled before being sent up the elevators to the main arena surface.

**Visual Description:**
A wide, circular stone chamber with a high, vaulted ceiling losing itself in darkness. The main features are the massive hydraulic elevators that grind and hiss in the center. Along the walls are racks of dull weapons and cages containing chirping, vicious Saibaman sprouts. The floor is stained with centuries of nervous sweat and spilled blood.

**Features:**
- **The Elevators**: Massive platforms leading to the surface.
- **Weapon Racks**: Dull swords, rusted axes, cracked shields.
- **The Pit**: A central depression where slaves wait.

**Occupants:**
- 50-100 Slave Class Saiyans.
- 5-10 Saibamen (Caged).
- 2 Elite Overseers.
