**Tags**: #location #subterranean #stealth #tech

## Description
A labyrinth of service conduits running beneath the Orbital Arena's surface plating. Originally designed for waste disposal and coolant transport, these cramped, cylindrical corridors are now a rusted maze of hissing pipes, dripping coolant, and flickering emergency lights.

The air here is thick with moisture and the smell of ozone. The sound of the battle above is muffled, replaced by the rhythmic clanking of machinery and the scuttle of vermin.

## Key Features
- **Cramped Confines**: Fighting here is difficult with large weapons.
- **Steam Vents**: Random bursts of scalding steam (Hazard).
- **Acoustics**: Sound travels effectively. Stealth is harder if you are noisy.
