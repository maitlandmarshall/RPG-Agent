# Slave Pens - Sector 4

Located beneath the great Imperial Arena, Sector 4 is a damp, dimly lit dungeon where the lowest class of Saiyans—and other conquered races—are kept between matches.

**Visual Description:**
The sector is a long, claustrophobic corridor of dark grey volcanic stone. The ceiling is low and oppressive, dripping with condensation. On either side, rusted iron bars floor-to-ceiling form the cells, packed with miserable bodies. The only light comes from high, narrow vents that bleed in the crimson light of the red suns, casting long, cage-like shadows across the dirty floor. The air is thick with dust and despair.

**Features:**
- **Cells**: Small, stone enclosures with iron bars. No privacy.
- **Lighting**: Crimson sunlight filtering through high vents; otherwise flickering torchlight.
- **Atmosphere**: Smells of sweat, blood, and ozone.
- **Security**: Medium. Shackles dampen power levels. Guards are competent but lazy.
