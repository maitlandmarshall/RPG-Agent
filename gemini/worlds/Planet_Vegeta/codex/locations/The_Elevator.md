# The Great Elevator

A marvel of Saiyan engineering (stolen from tech-traders). Massive platforms capable of lifting entire battalions from the depths of the slave pits to the surface arena.

**Description:**
A grid of heavy industrial metal platforms locked into rails that run miles deep into the planet's crust. As it rises, it passes through layers of ancient ruins before breaking the surface.

**Atmosphere:**
Loud. Creating a deafening mechanical roar. The wind whips fiercely as it ascends.
