# Zorn (Squad 7 Leader)

A wiry, intense Saiyan who has survived three culls by being faster and meaner than everyone else. He has appointed himself leader of Squad 7.

**Physical Description:**
Standard Saiyan build—athletic, spiky black hair. Distinguishable by a jagged scar running from his ear to his chin, and mismatched scavenged armor (one red shoulder pad, one white).

**Personality:**
Aggressive, paranoid, but tactically sound. He trusts no one, especially "new blood."

**Stats:**
- **Power Level**: 850 (Respectable for a slave)
- **Specialty**: Speed / Blitz Tactics
