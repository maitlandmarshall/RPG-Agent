# Warden Nappa (Slave Overseer)

**(Not the General Nappa)**
A distant relative of the elite Nappa, sharing the bald pate and burly physique but lacking the combat prowess to serve in the elite corps. Instead, he serves as a cruel overseer in the slave pens, taking out his inadequacy on those weaker than him.

**Stats:**
- **Power Level**: 4,000 (Elite compared to slaves, trash compared to the army)
- **Disposition**: Cruel, Sadistic, Lazy
- **Equipment**: Standard Saiyan Armor (Old model), Shock Baton

**Notes:**
- Has a gambling habit.
- Dislikes "uppity" slaves.
