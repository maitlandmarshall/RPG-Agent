# Feral Saibaman

**Tags**: #creature #bio-weapon #hostile

## Description
Failed experiments from the Royal Science Directorate's bio-engineering division. Unlike the cultivated Saibamen used by elite squads, these "ferals" are stunted, malnourished, and uncontrollably aggressive.

They have green, wrinkled skin that looks like rotting cabbage, massive claws, and oversized heads that pulse with unstable acid. They lack the intelligence to follow orders, operating purely on hunger.

## Combat Stats (Estimated)
- **Power Level**: 40 - 80 (Weak, but swarm tactics)
- **Attacks**: Claws, Acid Spit, Self-Destruct (Unstable).
- **Weakness**: bright light, precise energy strikes to the head.
