![Cress Portrait](Cress/portrait_v2.png)

A Slave Class Saiyan born into the dust of the Arena. Malnourished but hiding a burning potential.

**Physical Description:**
Cress has a sharp, angular face with hollow cheeks from years of malnutrition. His hair is a matted, choppy mess of brown (not black) that hangs over his eyes, lacking the defiant spikes of purebred warriors. A jagged, pale scar runs diagonally across the bridge of his nose—a gift from a guard's whip. His eyes are a dull onyx, burning with a quiet, suppressed rage. He wears a tunic stitched together from grey industrial scraps, and his wrists are bound in heavy, rusted iron shackles that chafe his skin.
