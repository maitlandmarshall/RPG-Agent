# Session 2: The Ascension

***

**Status Update:**
- **XP**: 50 (Unspent)
- **Health**: 70/100 (Bacta-Foam Recovery)
- **Fatigue**: 60/100 (Still exhausted, but adrenaline is fading)

The Saibaman's corpse is dragged away, leaving a smear of green blood on the stones. You are shoved onto the central platform along with fifty other survivors.

**[Elite Overseer Krel](../codex/characters/Elite_Overseer_Krel.md)** steps onto a higher, shielded platform. He looks down at the group with his trademark boredom.

"Phase One complete," he announces, his voice amplified by the pit acoustics. "You have proven you can kill mindless beasts. Now, you will prove if you are worthy to serve the Empire."

The platform shudders. Massive gears groan beneath your feet.

**The Ascent begins.**

![The Ascent](assets/the_ascension_view.png)

Slowly at first, then with bone-rattling speed, the elevator begins to rise. The crimson light of the slave pens recedes, replaced by the rushing darkness of the shaft.

Through the gaps in the cage, you see the planet's history flashing by—massive ancient stone ruins and carvings buried deep in the crust, illuminated briefly by the sparks of the lift's passage.

Wind whips at your tattered tunic. You look around at the other survivors. Faces are gaunt, terrified, or—in a few rare cases—excited.

![Crowd Faces](assets/ascension_crowd_faces.png)

**What do you do during the ascent?**
(Rest/Meditate, Inspect the other slaves, Talk to someone, Look for an escape route...)

***

You ignore the terror around you. You close your eyes, shutting out the roar of the wind and the smell of fear. You focus inward, searching for that spark—the same one that exploded in the pit. You try to coax it to your ribs, to your burns.

**Skill Check: Ki Control (1) vs DC 30 (Calm +10)**
> **Result**: Success (Margin +5)

![Meditation](assets/cress_meditation.png)

It's faint, like a heartbeat under deep water, but you feel it. A soothing warmth spreads through your chest. The stinging of the burns fades to a dull ache. Your breathing steadies.

**Status Update:**
- **Health**: 80/100 (+10 Recovery)
- **Fatigue**: 40/100 (-20 Rest)

The elevator shudders violently as it hits the upper atmospheric brakes. The darkness of the shaft gives way to blinding, stark white light.

**You have reached the Surface.**

A massive blast door groans open, revealing the **[Imperial Arena Staging Grounds](../codex/locations/Staging_Grounds.md)**.

It is a jungle of concrete and steel, filled with thousands of warriors.

***

You step off the platform into the chaos. The air here tastes different—metallic, charged with ozone and the roar of a million voices. The sky above is a bruised purple, dominated by the massive floating structure of the Royal Box miles away.

Around you, the "Ascended" are being corralled into processing lines. High above, Frieza Force ships dart like wasps.

![Processing Line](assets/processing_line_detail.png)

**What do you do?**
(Inspect the competition, Look for weapons/supplies, Try to slip away into the crowd, Find a medic for your burns...)

***

You keep your head down. You conform. You shuffle forward with the mass of bodies, stepping over the weak who collapse from the ascent.

A guard in heavy armor slams a metal scanner against your chest. "Clear," he barks, then shoves something heavy into your hands.

**Acquired: [Rusted Saiyan Blade](../codex/items/Rusted_Saiyan_Blade.md)**

![Rusted Blade](assets/rusted_blade_received.png)

"Squad 7," the guard grunts, shoving you toward a holding pen on the far side of the tarmac. "Move. If you aren't in the pen in five minutes, I shoot you myself."

You grip the rusted iron hilt. It's heavy, unbalanced, and smells of old blood. But it's steel.

**Squad 7** seems to be a motley collection of survivors huddled near a landing pad.

**What do you do?**
(Head to Squad 7, Inspect your new weapon, Hide the weapon and look for a better one...)

***

You step out of the processing line and find a momentary shadow behind a stack of crates. You lift the blade, turning it in the harsh purple light. Your hands are still shaking from the ascent, but your eyes are sharp.

**Skill Check: Intellect (10) vs DC 15 (Material Analysis, Shaky Hands -5)**
> **Result**: Success (Margin +2)

It looks like scrap, but as you thumb the edge, you realize the rust is superficial. The core is high-carbon durasteel. Beneath the grime near the hilt, you find a small, stamped sigil: **"Armory 44 - Rejected."**
It's not broken; it was just ugly. It will hold an edge if you sharpen it.

**Item Updated: [Rusted Saiyan Blade](../codex/items/Rusted_Saiyan_Blade.md)**
- **Hidden Trait**: *Quality Steel* (Durability is Medium, not Low).

Satisfied, you slide the blade into your belt.

**Squad 7** is waiting. A group of four other Saiyans and one massive, insectoid alien are arguing over a map component.

**What do you do?**
(Head to Squad 7, Inspect your new weapon, Hide the weapon and look for a better one...)

***

You approach the landing pad. The argument stops as you get close.

Five heads turn.

**[Zorn](../codex/characters/Zorn.md)**, the Saiyan in the center, steps forward. He has a jagged scar running down his cheek and mismatched armor that looks like it was ripped off a corpse. He looks you up and down, his eyes lingering on your scrawny build and the rusted blade in your belt.

"Well," Zorn spits, "Looks like they're scraping the bottom of the barrel. You the reinforcement?"

Next to him, a large insectoid alien chitters. The vocoder around its neck buzzes.
**[Klik](../codex/characters/Klik.md)**: "Stats... negligible. Biological mass... insufficient. Expected survival time: 4 minutes."

![Squad 7](assets/squad_7_encounter.png)

Zorn laughs—a sharp, barking sound. "Four minutes? I give him two."

He steps into your personal space, smelling of ozone and dried sweat.
"Name's Zorn. This is Squad 7. We survive because we aren't dead weight. Prove you aren't dead weight, runt."

**What do you do?**
(Introduce yourself challenge him, Show off your Ki (Skill Check), Stay silent and fall in line, Ask about the mission...)
