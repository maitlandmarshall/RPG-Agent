![The view from your cell](001_Slave_Pens/slave_pens_dawn.png)

## Date: 1 Year B.D. (Before Destruction)
## Location: Imperial Arena Slave Pens, Sector 4

The red light of Planet Vegeta's suns bleeds through the barred window, painting the stone floor in shades of dried blood. Your stomach growls—a low, primal rumble that echoes in the small, damp cell. The gravity here feels heavier than usual today, or perhaps that's just the exhaustion of yesterday's 'training.'

You are **Cress**, a Slave Class Saiyan. Your power level is a pathetic 5. To the elites in the spires above, you are less than dirt. You are fodder.

The heavy iron door groans. **Warden Nappa**—not the elite general, but a cruel, distant relative with the same bald head and twice the sadism—stalks down the corridor. His scouter beeps rhythmically.

"Wake up, filth!" he bellows, dragging a metal baton across the bars. "The prelims start in one hour. If you don't fight today, you don't eat."

He stops in front of your cell. "You. Runt. You're up against a Saibaman sprout today. Try not to die in the first ten seconds; I have a bet on you lasting twelve."

He tosses a meager nutrient bar through the bars. It lands in the dust near your shackled feet.

**Immediate Stats:**
- **Health**: 100/100
- **Hunger**: 50/100 (Starving)
- **Fatigue**: 20/100

**Options:**
- Eat the nutrient bar immediately (Safety).
- Hide the food for later and train in the remaining hour (Risk: Hunger, Gain: XP).
- Inspect your shackles (Skill: Intellect).
- Talk back to Nappa (Risk: Combat/Punishment).

***

You snatch the nutrient bar from the dust, tearing off the wrapper with your teeth. It tastes like compressed chalk and stale oil, but your body accepts it greedily. The gnawing ache in your stomach subsides just enough to let you think.

Swallowing the dry mouthful, you look up at the towering figure. "Advice?" you ask, your voice raspy. "Any advice for the ring?"

**Skill Check: Charisma (10) vs DC 60**
> **Result**: Critical Failure (Margin -29)

The silence that follows is heavier than the gravity. Nappa blinks, his piggish eyes widening. Then, a low, wet rumble starts in his chest. He laughs—a hacking, wheezing sound that shakes his paunch.

"Advice?" he wheezes, wiping a tear from his eye. "The runt wants *advice*!"

His hand moves faster than you can track. The shock baton lashes out, crackling with yellow electricity, and slams into your shoulder.

**CRACK.**

Pain explodes down your arm, driving you to your knees. The smell of singed rag and ozone fills your nose.

"Here's my advice, slave," Nappa snarls, his amusement vanishing instantly. "**Scream loud.** It makes the nobles bet higher."

He kicks the cell door. The lock buzzes and disengages with a heavy clank. The door swings open.

"Get moving. Sector 4 assembly area. If you're late, I feed you to the Saibaman raw."

**Status Update:**
- **Hunger**: 20/100 (Satiated)
- **Health**: 90/100 (Shock Damage)
- **Fatigue**: 25/100 (Pain)

***

You scramble to your feet, clutching your throbbing shoulder. The pain radiates down your side with every step, turning your run into a lopsided limp. You grit your teeth and force your legs to move, navigating the labyrinthine corridors of Sector 4.

**Skill Check: Endurance (15) vs DC 20 (Haste)**
> **Result**: Critical Failure (Margin -30)

Your vision blurs from the shock. You take a wrong turn, stumbling into a dead-end maintenance shaft before correcting yourself. Precious minutes bleed away.

By the time you burst into the **Sector 4 Assembly Area**, the ranks have already formed.

It is a cavernous stone pit, loud with the bark of overseers and the chirp of monsters.

![Assembly Area](../codex/locations/Assembly_Area/view.png)

**Elite Overseer Krel**—a warrior wearing the pristine white armor of the Frieza Force—stands on a raised dais, reading from a datapad.

He stops as you stumble in, panting, face grey with pain. The entire assembly turns to look at you.

"Late," Krel notes, his voice bored but carrying over the din. "Sloppy. And damaged."

He gestures to a cage near the front. Inside, a green, veiny creature—a **Saibaman Sprout**—scratches at the bars, screeching when it sees you.

"Put him in the first wave," Krel orders. "If he's in such a rush to die, let's accommodate him."

Two guards grab your arms and drag you toward the center of the pit. The cage door slides open.

**Combat Start: Cress vs. Saibaman Sprout**
**Opponent**: Power Level 200 (Restrained/Young).
**Conditions**:
- You are **Injured** (-10 to Agility).
- You are **Winded** (-10 to Strength).

**What do you do?**
(Attack, Defend, Look for a weapon, Use the environment...)
