## Date: 1 Year B.D. (Before Destruction)
## Location: Imperial Arena Slave Pens, Sector 4

The red light of Planet Vegeta's suns bleeds through the barred window, painting the stone floor in shades of dried blood. Your stomach growls—a low, primal rumble that echoes in the small, damp cell. The gravity here feels heavier than usual today, or perhaps that's just the exhaustion of yesterday's 'training.'

You are **Cress**, a Slave Class Saiyan. Your power level is a pathetic 5. To the elites in the spires above, you are less than dirt. You are fodder.

The heavy iron door groans. **Warden Nappa**—not the elite general, but a cruel, distant relative with the same bald head and twice the sadism—stalks down the corridor. His scouter beeps rhythmically.

"Wake up, filth!" he bellows, dragging a metal baton across the bars. "The prelims start in one hour. If you don't fight today, you don't eat."

He stops in front of your cell. "You. Runt. You're up against a Saibaman sprout today. Try not to die in the first ten seconds; I have a bet on you lasting twelve."

He tosses a meager nutrient bar through the bars. It lands in the dust near your shackled feet.

**Immediate Stats:**
- **Health**: 100/100
- **Hunger**: 50/100 (Starving)
- **Fatigue**: 20/100

**Options:**
- Eat the nutrient bar immediately (Safety).
- Hide the food for later and train in the remaining hour (Risk: Hunger, Gain: XP).
- Inspect your shackles (Skill: Intellect).
- Talk back to Nappa (Risk: Combat/Punishment).
